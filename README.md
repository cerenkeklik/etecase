run frontend: 
    cd etefrontend > npm start

run backend: 
    cd etebackend > npm run dev    

I have used mongoDB as DB. Then in nodejs express project, I have managed the data, CRUD process.
Frontend can be better especially design and creativity in dashboard. But I prefer to code backend as well.
